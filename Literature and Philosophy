We are concerned with teaching great literature that will stay with people and concerns itself with the human condition, and exposure to genres. Children will happily read light entertainment like Tolkein and JK Rowling on their own without school needing to be involved.

We will aim to cover great literature without favour towards British writers. There are many great writers outside of the UK. We will teach various genres to children.
