Children should be given a foundation in history and styles of art, to expand their minds and to see greater opportunities. This will also cover sculpture and architecture. We will cover the following areas:-

- Prehistoric cave art
- Antiquity (mostly Roman, Greek, Chinese)
- Islamic art and architecture.
- Romanesque (particularly Bayeux Tapestry)
- Gothic art and architecture
- Renaissance
- Baroque
- Rococo
- Neoclassical
- Romantic
- Impressionist
- Art Nouveau

At a simple level they should understand (including practicals) how art is produced.

The history of film and techniques should also be covered from early work, through black and white, sound, colour and into digital.

We should also talk about the social, technological and political changes around art, and the purpose for much art (government and religious propaganda, marriage of aristocrats).
