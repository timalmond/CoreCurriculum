These are the tenets of this project:-

- The school serves its pupils. They are not members of the school, or there to boost the prestige of the school.
- We aim to teach what will be generally useful to children, and useful long after they leave.
- We are not here just to babysit.
- We are not interested in nostalgia. That which is proposed must be defended on current merits, not on the past.
- We are not interesed in fashion. That which is proposed must not simply be based on short-term fashions as this can quickly shift. Many subjects will be limited to only that which is over 50 years old as an anti-fashion mechanism.
- We are not interested in propaganda. We aim to make children freer and more powerful, not making them obedient to government and institutions.
- We are not interested in covering things "because they are interesting". Many things are of particular interest to particular people. This does not make them generally useful.
- We are not interested in teaching things that parents should be able to teach. If they are unable to do this, that is their problem.
- We do not believe in teaching fragility.
