These are the tenets of this project:-

- We aim to teach what will be generally useful to people for as long as possible. 
- Time is limited. Teaching one thing is at the exclusion of another.
- We are not interested in nostalgia. That which is proposed must be defended on current merits, not on the past.
- We are not interesed in fashion. That which is proposed must not simply be based on short-term fashions as this can quickly shift. Many subjects will be limited to only that which is over 50 years old as an anti-fashion mechanism.
- We are not interested in propaganda. This is learning to improving people's lives, to make them freer and more powerful, not making them obedient to government and institutions.
- We are not interested in covering things "because they are interesting". Many things are of particular interest to particular people. This does not make them generally useful.
- We are not interested in teaching things that parents can easily teach and do not aim to fix that if parents fail.
