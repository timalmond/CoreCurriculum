## Things that Children should learn at school

Some of us don't believe that much of school is particularly useful. To read and write, to do arithmetic, to understand some of the basics of science are clearly useful. But much of what is taught is now fashionable or redundant.

When we say "useful", this does not simply mean that we seek only those things that improve people's chances of getting a job or a better job. Useful can include anything that gives people a more fulfilling adult life. And it does not mean that it aims to cover everything, but what is core, general. Just because we believe that trigonometry is not generally useful does not mean that it is not specifically useful to some people.

## Tenets

- The school serves its pupils. They are not members of the school, or there to boost the prestige of the school.
- We aim to teach what will be generally useful to children, and useful long after they leave.
- We are not here just to babysit.
- We are not interested in nostalgia. That which is proposed must be defended on current merits, not on the past.
- We are not interesed in fashion. That which is proposed must not simply be based on short-term fashions as this can quickly shift. Many subjects will be limited to only that which is over 50 years old as an anti-fashion mechanism.
- We are not interested in propaganda. We aim to make children freer and more powerful, not making them obedient to government and institutions.
- We are not interested in covering things "because they are interesting". Many things are of particular interest to particular people. This does not make them generally useful.
- We are not interested in teaching things that parents should be able to teach. If they are unable to do this, that is their problem.
- We do not believe in teaching fragility.
