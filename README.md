## Things that Children should learn at school

Some of us don't believe that much of school is particularly useful. To read and write, to do arithmetic, to understand some of the basics of science are clearly useful. But much of what is taught is now fashionable or redundant.

When we say "useful", this does not simply mean that we seek only those things that improve people's chances of getting a job or a better job. Useful can include anything that gives people a more fulfilling adult life. And it does not mean that it aims to cover everything, but what is core, general. Just because we believe that trigonometry is not generally useful does not mean that it is not specifically useful to some people.
